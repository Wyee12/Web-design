                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Yes. It is necessary for someone to be available to accept delivery as we use a secure courier who requires a signature as proof of receipt.</br>
                        Furthermore, our carriers provide a door-to-door service, which does not include carrying the items inside, carrying items up stairs, placement, 
                        or removal of packaging. 
                        If your order includes larger items or you are not comfortable carrying your items, we suggest having an additional person to assist with the 
                        placement of your items inside.</p>
